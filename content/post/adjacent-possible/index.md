title: "Adjacent Possible: Peeking into the Future"
---

There are [100s of cases][2] of important discoveries being made independently
by different people at almost exactly the same time: calculus (1600s), the
telegraph (1837), the light bulb (1879), the jet engine (1840), and the
telephone (1876). A recent example was Spectre/Meltdown (2018), possibly the
most impactful publicly disclosed security vulnerability of the past decade.
Despite its fiendish complexity it was [discovered independently by two
teams][3] that year.

Why does this happen?

In ["Where Good Ideas Come From,"][1], Johnson explains the idea of the
'adjacent possible', pioneered by Stuart Kauffman about how biological systems
morph into complex systems. The adjacent possible idea explains simultaneous
innovation.  It's one of those ideas that to me was so powerful it's hard to
remember how I thought about innovation prior to learning about it.

To borrow Johnson's analogy for the adjacent possible: when you build or improve
something, imagine yourself as opening a new door. You've unlocked a new room.
This room, in turn, has even _more_ doors to be unlocked. Each innovation or
improvement unlocks even more improvements and innovations. What the doors lead
you to is what we call the 'adjacent possible.' The adjacent possible is what's
about a door away from being invented. I like to visualize the adjacent possible
as coloured ("built") and uncoloured ("not built") nodes in a simple graph:

When Gutenberg invented the printing press, it was in the adjacent possible from
the invention of movable type, ink, paper, and the wine press. He had to
customize the ink, press, and invent molds for the type -- but the printing
press was very much ripe for plucking in the adjacent possible.

{{< img "*adjacent_possible_printing_press*" "Adjacent Possible Printing Press" >}}

When you internalize it, you start seeing it everywhere.

Here's Safi Bahcall painting a picture of navigating the adjacent possible,
focusing in particular on the importance of fundamental research, a door opener
that might not always get the credit and funding it deserves:

> "The vast majority of the most important breakthroughs in drug discovery have
> hopped from one lily pad to another until they cleared their last challenge.
> Only after the last jump, from the final lily pad, would those ideas win wide
> acclaim."
> -- [Safi Bahcall, Loonshots][8]

Of course, it took ingenuity for Gutenberg to combine these components to make
the printing press. It's certainly a pattern that the inventor has a profound
familiarity with each component. Gutenberg grew up close to the wine districts
of South-Western Germany, so he was familiar with the wine press. He had to
customize the press, in the same way that much experimentation lead him to come
up with an oil-based ink that worked with his movable type (for which he needed
to invent molds).

But reality is that if Gutenberg hadn't invented the printing press, someone
else would have. The inventors of the transistor admitted this outright. The
Bell Labs semiconductor team understood that when you are picking off the
adjacent possible, someone else will get there eventually. In this case, the
transistor had come into the adjacent possible from the increased understanding
of e.g. the basic research in atomic structure and understanding of electrons
conducted by scientists such as Bohr and J. J. Thompson.

Edison came to this conclusion too:

> environment – I took them out. I've created nothing. Nobody does. There's no
> such thing as an idea being brain-born; everything comes from the outside.

Numerous quotes can be found about how innovations are plucked out of the
adjacent possible like ripe fruits:

> place where it's almost impossible not to see the new thing, and it often
> happens that the new step is done contemporaneously in two different places in

The adjacent possible is a possible explanation for why simultaneous innovation
is so common.

You may recognize the adjacent possible as another angle on Newton's phrase that
we 'stand on the shoulders of giants' (coloured nodes in the adjacent possible).
'Great artists steal', because otherwise how would we launch into the adjacent
possible? The greatest artists might just be the ones that create the nodes with
the most connections, such as Picasso's influence in cubism, or Emerson's
in transcendentalism.

You might initially think this is a depressing thought. Are all innovations
inevitable? Some teams in history have mowed through the adjacent possible
at unprecedented speeds. Think of the Manhatten Project. The Apollo Project.
Neither of those were in the adjacent possible. They were in the far remote
possible. Many, many doors out. But these teams pushed through.  To a company,
the momentum provided by breaking through the adjacent possible first can be
difficult to catch up with, such as Google and their page-rank search algorithm.
Some areas might be simply neglected, e.g. pandemic prevention.

The adjacent possible can teach us an important lesson about being too early. To
someone working in the adjacent possible, being too early and wrong is one and
the same. I've heard [Tobi Lutke][7] say a few times that "predicting the future
is easy, but timing it is hard." Sure, we know that autonomous vehicles are
coming (predicting the future), but are you wiling to put any money on when
(predicting timing)?

For example, residential internet was not geared yet for responsive online games
in the early 90s.  It was too early, even if game developers _knew_ it was
eventually going to be a thing. It was in the remote possible, but not the
adjacent possible. Not enough pre-requisite doors had been opened: home internet
speed weren't good enough, research on how to deal with network latency was
poor, and setting up servers all around the world to minimize latency was a lot
of work. Being too early means confusing the adjacent and remote possible.

Despite online gaming being too early to become ubiquitous, the stage was set
for the web. Half-coloured nodes signal immaturity:

While Wilbur Wright knew we'd one day fly (_remote possible_), he had no idea if
it was in the adjacent possible. He especially didn't know the timing. But he
went to the Kitty Hawk sand dunes with their flimsy plane anyway:

> "I confess that, in 1901, I said to my brother Orville that men would not fly

Bell Labs developed the "picture phone" in the 1960s and 1970s, but they found
themselves branching off nodes in the adjacent possible that made it _possible_,
but without product/market fit. It's possible to navigate into the adjacent
possible using the wrong doors: `camera + cables + packet_switching + tv` does
not necessarily equal a successful commercial 'video phone'. Video telephony
wouldn't be in the adjacent possible in a shape consumers would embrace for
another 40-50 years when convenience, price, and form factor would change with
every laptop having a webcam and every phone a front-facing camera. Babbage also
got his timing wrong.  He was ~100 years too early with the first computer
design, too.

These are individual failures, but part of a healthy system. We _need_ people to
try. While I believe this model is useful to reason about what can be built,
it's just as likely to make you reason incorrectly about why not to build
something. You may very likely use this model to be wrong, as an excuse not
to be venture into the fog of war. You won't always know all your dependencies.

In the late 90s, LEGO was aggressively diversifying from the brick into video
games, movies, theme parks, and more.  Like the plastic mold had enabled the
brick's transition from wood to plastic, they thought that a digital environment
with all possible bricks might start the next wave of innovation for LEGO. They
bought the biggest Silicon Graphics machine in all of Scandinavia and put it in
a tiny town in Denmark to computer-render the bricks to perfection. LEGO was
eager to use the newest graphics technology, the most recently opened door, and
marry it with LEGO.  Unsurprisingly, the graphics team never shipped anything.
When a door's just been opened, you're almost certainly going to run into
problems with immaturity (a contemporary example would be cryptocurrency).  You
only have to look at Minecraft's success a decade later to know what could've
succeeded: much simpler graphics. LEGO must've grinned their teeth when they saw
Minecraft take off.

Just because big graphics computers exist doesn't mean you have to use them.
It's very easy to confuse the _eventually/remote possible_ with the _adjacent
possible_. If you find yourself pushing, pushing, and pushing, but every
dependency seems to fail you -- your dependencies [are too immature][6]. Every
project has dependencies, but only the immature ones stand out. You don't think
about electricity as a risky dependency for a project (but you might have in the
1880s), but consumer adoption of VR certainly would be. Smartphones might have
been a risky dependency a decade ago, but wouldn't be considered risky by anyone
today. QR-codes might have appeared risky in the West 5-years ago, but is
somewhere between "people get it" and "not completely mature" now. In China,
however, it's common that food menus come with QR-codes. 

When the transistor was invented at Bell Labs, Bell didn't immediately replace
every vacuum tube amplifier with it in their telephony cabling (amplifiers are
used to counteract the natural fading of the signal over long distances). It
would take at least a decade to get the price, manufacturing, and reliability of
the transistor to the point where it could replace the vacuum tube with half a
century of R&D behind it.  In fact, they were still laying down massive,
cross-country and oceanic cables with vacuum tubes for years after the
transistor was invented, patiently waiting it to mature. I'm sure you've seen a
project fail because, by analogy, you 'started cabling with transistors
immediately after its discovery.' Sometimes you just need to bite your lip and
go with the vacuum tube.

Despite this, it didn't make Bell any less excited about the transistor. They
knew that the vacuum tube's potential had been maxed out, while the transistor's
was just starting. Even today, as we reach `5nm` (orders and orders of magnitude
smaller and faster) transitors, the transitor's potential still hasn't been
depleted. Although we're inching closer and closer...

Wilbur Wright made a similar remark about the limits of airship, after trying
one for the first time on a trip to Europe:

It's important to note that improving something existing can open doors just as
much as inventing something entirely new. When gas gets 20% cheaper, people
don't just drive 20% more, they [might drive 40% more][4]. Behaviour changes.
Suddenly it looks economical to move a little further out, visit that relative
who lives in the country, or drive 10 hours on vacation.

As another example, the current wave of AI is fuelled by the massive
improvements in compute speed over the past few decades, partly from graphics
cards originally developed for video games. AI had been hanging out in the
remote possible for decades, just waiting for compute to hit a certain
speed/cost threshold to make them economically feasible. You might not use AI to
sort your search results if it costs $10 in compute per search, but when the
cost has generously compounded down to a micro-dollar, it very well might be.

The same iterative improvements are what made the transistor so successful.
Fundamentally, it can do the same as a vacuum tube: amplify and switch signals.
Initially, it was much more expensive, but smaller and more reliable (no light
to attract bugs) -- which allowed it to flourish only in niche use-cases far
upmarket, e.g. in the US millitary.  But over time, the transistor beat the
vacuum tube in every way (although, some audiophiles still prefer the 'sound' of
vacuum tubes?!).

To use our new vocabulary, the transistor only initially expanded the adjacent
possible for a few cases.  Over time as iterative, consistent improvements were
made to price, size, and reliability, the transistor became the root of the
largest expanse of the 'possible' in human history. It didn't open doors, it
opened up new continents. A more contemporary example might be home and mobile
Internet speeds, for which consistent, iterative improvements has expanded the
adjacent possible with streaming, video games, video chat, and photo-video heavy
social media.

It's not possible to predict exactly what [doors an improvement unlocks][5].
This is a space of unknown-unknowns, but, hopefully positive ones. If we look at
history, making things cheaper, smaller, faster, and more reliable tends to
expand the adjacent possible. It wasn't some magical new invention that made AI
take off in the past 7-10 years, it was iterative changes: cheaper, faster
compute, available on demand in the Cloud. Every time these improve by 10%,
something new is feasible.

As an example of perfect timing into the adjacent possible, consider Netflix'
pivot into streaming. The technology they used initially was a little whacky
(Silverlight), but it was good enough to give them an initial momentum that's
still carrying them today. They timed the technology and the market perfectly:
home Internet speeds, browser technology, etc.

When you find yourself in a spot where you have your eyes on something that's a
few doors out from where you're standing, that means it's time to reconsider
your approach. When Apple released the iPod in 2001, they surely were eyeing a
phone in the _remote possible_. They knew that going straight for it, they'd be
blasting through doors at a pace that'd yield an immature, poor product. They
found a way to sustainably open the doors for a phone through the iPod.
When you find a seemingly intractable problems, there's almost always a
tractable problem worth solving hiding inside of it as a stepping stone.

Framing problems as the 'adjacent possible' has been a liberating idea to me. In
the work I do, I try to find the doors that lead to the biggest possible
expansion of the possible. That's what makes platform work so exciting to me.
