<p>There's little to no literature out there on the depths of streaming systems at scale. If you've read the paper, this is essentially the same format, but with much more detail. If you're interested in Dataflow/BEAM/Streaming, this is a must-read to get familiar with watermarks, joins, etc. To claim the other two stars, it'd need to be slightly more pedagogical and grounded in more examples.</p>
