<p>This book centers around the topic of the resistence to do the things that are important. Others might call it procrastination. This resistance thrives on our fears. The author makes the argument that the things that are most important, are the ones that we fear to do the most. Both to fail, but also to succeed. There's no magical solution to getting past resistance, you simply have to sit down every day and get to work. This subject is definitely worthy of a book, but I thought this book took a too religious angle by the end that I couldn't resonate with.</p>
