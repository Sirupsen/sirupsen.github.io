<p>As a European, the idea that the partner of a significant figure is significant by association is foreign. This book completely changed my view. Michelle comes from humble beginnings, South Side of Chicago, and was contributing to impactful non-profits long before Barack took the highest office. First Lady is not a job-title, rather, Michelle found that she could use it as a platform to exert values she's always fought for: black rights, women's rights, and education. The first half is about time before the presidency, and the second half the election and forward. A first-person narration with a deep, honest emotional depth. I enjoyed the audiobook, narrated by Michelle, a lot. I have tremendous respect for the Obamas. The biggest thing I was missing was much more depth on what they plan to use their foundation for going forward.</p>
