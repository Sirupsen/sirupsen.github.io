<p>I was searching for an audiobook that'd be easy to listen to for a week with a lot of long flights. I think it delivered there. The tech-bitter author takes us through his personal journey in the Silicon Valley mill. He's definitely going for the Liar's Poker of Tech. Nothing special, but decent entertainment, possibly because as an insider in the industry there's nothing terribly surprising.</p>
