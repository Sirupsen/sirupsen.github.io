      I really liked it. Sums up all the content I've been able to find from Netflix on this topic in the past, and adds more. It answered a couple of questions I've had for a while about the practise as a whole. This is complementary to a book like Release It, with more focus on defining the discipline, rather than go into the nitty-gritty of the engineering.
