      I don't know much about images and how to use them on the web. It goes over most of that, but also spends pages and pages on techniques that "the author doesn't use but are nice to know." Ugh, put that in an appendix and give me the meat. He also goes just enough into how image compression works but then stops JUST as it gets interesting. Such a nerd tease, ugh.
