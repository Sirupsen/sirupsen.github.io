<p>What a fantastic book. Will presents a, for me, novel perspective on how we have yet to replace the strong moral code from religion, which may eventually backfire (or be superseded by communism). Another point, among many, that resonated strongly with me is that liberty comes from order, but with too much you may undermine the order that created it in the first place (anarchy). It's the uncanny valley of freedom, or tipping point. This booked is packed with useful observations concerning history, that are widely applicable. Definitely going to re-read this.</p>
