      What a fantastic example of narrated, non-fiction. The author has looked at weather reports, traveled, looked at turbulence data, and in general meticulously researched (with spreadsheets!) Ulbricht's whereabouts to provide the most compelling story possible. If you're looking for an enjoyable audiobook, I recommend it.
