      Intrigued by the topic I picked up this book, which highlights many issues with the current legal system in America and the overwhelming complexity and problems that arise from arriving at an extreme with law that tries to dictate behaviour, rather than guide it. However, the book is plenty lacking in instances where a better system has been successfuly implemented (other countries, part of the American legal system, a time where it worked better) and focuses a lot more on problematic anecdotes from the past 30 years.
