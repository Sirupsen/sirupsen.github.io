<p>An interesting book with a healthy skepticism on common sense, and people's intuition in statistics. However, this books reads more like a popular science magazine, than something to really broaden. It shows the results of a healthy, economic way of thinkingâ€”but it doesn't directly teach that way of approaching data outside of the examples presented in the books. The relationships found in the book are certainly interesting, but it's unlikely that I'll remember many of these facts.</p>
