      Lots of words, little substance. At some point, when I realized I'd read 50 pages with not a single highlight I started skimming rapidly. I was looking for some clever ideas on how to do performance testing, but I found nothing interesting. It wasn't clear to me what type of systems the author had built to make them credible on this topic. No dice... disappointed from the intriguing title.
