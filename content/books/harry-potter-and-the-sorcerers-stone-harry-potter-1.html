      Can't believe I've never read them. I had these read aloud to me as a kid (in Danish), but I've never sat down and read them. A nostalgic and humbling part about reading it was remembering my English teacher giving this book to me in 4th grade. I was struggling hard to get through the first few chapters and eventually gave up. I found the vocabulary much too advanced for my English at the time. There's a reason why these books are fantastic. I watched the movie immediately afterward, and I have to sayâ€”people give the movies more shit than they deserve from their "I've read it and it's missing some details" ivory tower. Those movies did a phenomenal job abbreviating where necessary, which a movie must.
