<p>Nothing you haven't heard before if you've been in tech for a bit. I was hoping for more good ideas and actionable items, e.g. how all-remote meetings are important, even if the majority of the team is in the meeting. However, not even that is in the book. Don't feel like I'll be coming much back to the ideas here, but this very well might be due to the fact that these ideas are already repeated around me.</p>
