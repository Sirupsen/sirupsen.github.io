<p>Collection of essays and newspaper articles from various financial panics, e.g. 2000 tech crash, 2008 crash, 1997 Asian currency crisis, and more. Reminds me that reading newspaper articles from the past can provide great entertainment and perspective, but 100s of pages of it isn't quite my cup of tea. Clearly the author wanted to deep-dive into these panics, but I wish he would've added some coloured rather than simply copy in articles.</p>
