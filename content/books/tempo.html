<p>Tempo is the pace at which something moves, whether a project, dinner party, or heart rate. We are highly influenced by the tempo around us, made up of rhytm, emotion, and energy. Changing a tempo is like a state transition, requiring activation energy to push it from one to the otherâ€”significantly harder than following the pace already set. Rao states that "emotion is the result of tempo of the environment not meeting expectations."<br /><br />All of that was in the first few chapters, and I enjoyed exploring this concept. Then it got so abstract that I could barely remember what I'd read. That's when I closed the book and moved on to something else.</p>
