<p>Great book on some of the most accomplished individuals in history and what they have in common: practice, practise, practiseâ€”the part of their story which is often let out when their victories are celebrates. While the book highlights amazing stories from people often not discussed in similar books, the book is quite repetitive, feels a little disorganized, and revisits the same examples multiple times extracting almost identical points.</p>
