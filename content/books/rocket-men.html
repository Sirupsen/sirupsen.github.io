<p>Every time I had a few minutes in the past week, I listened to this book. What a phenomenal account of the most important of the Apollo missions. Don't think I've gotten chills as many times as I did to this book. The only thing I was missing was a bit more depth on the physics, but I can't take it down from 5 stars. 5 stars to me means that I couldn't put it down, the entire thing was an absolute pleasure, it accomplished what it set out to do and more, and I feel that I can take major, applicable lessons from the book.</p>
