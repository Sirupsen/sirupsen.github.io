<p>The first book in the series. Somewhat slow start, but it really sets the frame for the following books. The second half of the book is fantastic and I started giggling with excitement that there were two more books after it on the last 100 pages. To intrigue, but not give too much away: Imagine getting contact with another species, what could happen on earth? This book is a fascinating journey into this.</p>
