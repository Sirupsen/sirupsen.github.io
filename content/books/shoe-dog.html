<p>Knight goes through the ups and downs of establishing Nike. He's a surprisingly good writer (if it's not a ghost-writer) and at times, you feel yourself holding on to the nearest stable object as you're taken through the riveting narrow escapes of company-ending events: law-suits, inventory chaos, and shoes in the wrong place, at the wrong time. Honest, and delightfully entertaining. Lacks the fifth star, because I do not see myself referring back to lessons from this book in the future. Most of the stories didnâ€™t seem to have that compact anecdotal quality to them.</p>
