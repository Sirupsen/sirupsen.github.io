<p>Interesting primer on a current edgy field of research in medicine. However, the author fails to highlight the evidence against "the power of git microbes", which leaves the reader somewhat skeptical as they finish the books. Nonetheless, there's obviously something there—but what exactly is still hard to determine, possibly because this is still early.</p>
