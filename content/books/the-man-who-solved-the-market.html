<p>Entertaining book, very enjoyable as an audio-book. More about the people behind Renaissance, the best performing hedge fund of all time, than the technology itself. One of the more scary stories is about Robert Mercer, former co-CEO of renaissance, who had a huge role in funding Trump's presidency with the billions he's made through Renaissance.<br /><br />Overall, probably not a story I'll see myself refer back to as much as I hoped, but Zuckerman put himself in a tough position trying to dig up information on one of the most secretive companies on earth.</p>
