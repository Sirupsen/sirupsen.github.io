This is a very qualitative read from a likeable palliative nurse, who listens to
dying patients as they are in their final weeks of life. I would say it's more
of an autobiography of someone in that setting, than anything else. I was
expecting something more quantitative in the form of e.g. analyzing survey
results. Either way, I ended up really enjoying it -- but it wasn't quite as
focused on the regrets of the dying as I had thought.
