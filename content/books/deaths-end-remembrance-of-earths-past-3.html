      Hovered between 4 and 5 stars for a while, but finally, decided on 5. While I enjoyed the 2nd book more, the 3rd book is still some fantastic science fiction. The first half I loved. The game theoretic component is my favorite part about this series, and that takes the backseat to the soft science fiction in the second half of the 3rd and final book. <br /><br />Overall, the trilogy comes highly recommended.
