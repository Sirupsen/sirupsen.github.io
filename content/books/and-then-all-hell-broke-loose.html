<p>Engel leaves New York for Egypt in 1996, and reports from the field on the wars in Afganistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Tunisia, Libya, and Syria. This book provides a narrative for 20 years in the region, Engel is not afraid to offer his own opinion. We hear stories about reporting from inside a war zone, and Engel being kidnapped in Syria. I feel that this book has finally provided me with an overview of the complex conflicts in the Middle East. It processes the topic in a readable manor, making it an easy book to read.</p>
