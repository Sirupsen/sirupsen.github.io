<p>Loved this. Written as a novel following a couple with an Alain de Botton commentary track. The fictional story of what what a long-term relationship is truly like: ups, downs, and mehs. Through the early passion, working through the tough times with couple counseling, kids, several episodes of being on the brink of failure, and truly becoming partners in life going through all this together. This is a story of true partnership. Wish tangible fiction of this type was abundant.</p>
