<p>This is the most raw and brutal fiction I've read. It takes place onboard a a whaling ship making its way to the the waters between Greenland and Canada. In the extreme loneliness of the Northern Atlantic with its unpredictable weather, it turns out a murder has been committed onboard. But that's only the beginning as a polar nightmare unravels.. The intensity and atrocity of the last half is nuts and kept me glued in a way I haven't been to a piece of fiction since Harry Potter.</p>
