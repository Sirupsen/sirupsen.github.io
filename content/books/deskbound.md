The biggest take-away is that yes, we should stand more, and not just 2-3h a
day, but more than we sit. The other huge take-away is that you should have a
stool in front of you to lean your knees on, to allow yourself more different
standing positions. Tools for your feet to fidget with, are a good idea too.
Those things alone made a huge difference to me. I just push my chair under the
desk and lean against it sometimes to change how I stand.

The first 2-3 weeks are hell as you get used to it, but it's been worth it for
my upper-back tightness.

But, come on Kelly, you want me to not even have a desk that I can sit at, to
make sure I never sit?
