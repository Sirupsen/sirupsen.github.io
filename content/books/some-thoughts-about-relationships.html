<p>I've thoroughly enjoyed Wright's podcast "Let's Know Things." He spends 45 minutes diving deep into a concept such as plastic bags, soybeans, or privacy. There's just enough personal opinion and spin on top of fantastic accounts. Before I turn this into a podcast review: This book is a great compilation of 'relationship principles.' They are mostly commonsensical. That is, if someone else had spent a while with the same goal in mind (defining relationship policies), I'd be surprised if they ended up far from where Wright landed. That said, common sense just means that they are easy to acceptâ€”not that we implement them when we should. Wright's is a great compilation and reminder of how we should approach the relationships with friends, family, and partner.</p>
