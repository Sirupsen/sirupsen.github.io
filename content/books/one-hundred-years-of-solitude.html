<p>At the end of the day, this is a book about how we keep making the same mistakes. Some of the chapters are vivid: the chapter of when one of the main characters loses her vision, but doesn't even notice, I found fascinating. The one about when the village is hit by insomnia is great, too. It was a struggle for me to get through this book though, because I found it difficult to get into some of the chapters. It's incredibly difficult to get a mental map of the characters going (despite looking up the family tree online) because they all have the same names (again, to emphasize the point of family history repeating).</p>
