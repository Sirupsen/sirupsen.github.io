<p>Enjoyable! Robin has some outstanding one-liners here and there. Plot centers around an engineer who moves to San Francisco to work at a robotics company. Before long, she comes into possession of a mysterious sourdough that sends her head first into the world of baking. She approaches it the way any proud nerd would, venturing into the sourdough forums to find the perfect DIY wood-fired oven. From there, things get weird.<br /><br />3 stars not because I didn't enjoy this tremendously, but because I feel it won't be especially memorable.</p>
