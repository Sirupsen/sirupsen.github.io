<p>I enjoyed this book as a fairly quick read on various literary devices that make sentences memorable. Many of these devices are seen in famous quotes and marketing, and I was introduced to concepts such as 'diacope', which I didn't have a word for earlier. What I found interesting was that many of these literary devices are a feature of English, and don't work in other languages like my mother tongue. This was a good introduction to those. The author is funny, making this not a dry linguistic read, but an interesting little journey through literary devices with wonderful examples from literature.</p>
