<p>Chounaird has always despised businessmen, and then he became one.. the book is his memoir of his unlikely journey to owning a billion-dollar company. He's certainly an icon of what we need (but are depressingly unlikely to get..) much, much more of in the 21st century. Some is memoir, but most of the book are various environmental discourses on topics such as the importance of organic cotton farming, repairing instead of buying, and taking care of what we have left of the planet.</p>
