I've read quite a few books about how innovation works over the past few
years, and this is one of the better ones. If it's a topic that interests you,
pick it up. Unfortunately, I'd forgotten to mark it as read.. it's been a
while, so I forget exactly what I got from this and not others... but when
reviewing the highlights, they are all very familiar. That's a really good
sign.
