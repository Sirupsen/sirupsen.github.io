<p>Once in a while, it's healthy to hear a take on life by someone thoughtful. The majority of this book is somewhat dull, uneventful, with no particular take-aways. What carries this book is the last chapter, as he describes the way he's come to his own understanding of what's important in relationships. In particular, I enjoyed his way of describing the balance between independence and attachment.</p>
