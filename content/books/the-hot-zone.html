<p>I started listening to this on a walk... I didn't expect it to open with a vivid description of an ebola patient zero's journey from poking at bat poop in a cave in Africa, to trying to make it to a hospital alive while essentially turning into a walking corpse. Ugh. Book's terrifying, as it describes an air-borne outbreak in a Monkey Lab near D.C. I generally enjoyed it, nothing remarkable, but if nothing else, tells you how much worse a virus can be.</p>
