<p>Centered around 7 great questions to help any conversation go from small-talk to output. But it isn't just a checklist of answers for one-on-ones, it's also filled with nuggets on building long-term memory, other mental models for management, pragmatic lessons from neuroscience, as well as useful analogies. Some of my favorites were how people typically put themselves in the position of a rescuer, victim, or prosecutorâ€”either of which can be dangerous. It's tempting to feel it's a hero move to take it and "fix it," but it has pernicious consequences. The questions are well thought out, and solve real problems: When people spiral negatively, you ask them: What's the real challenge for you here? To take them back up. When they're not generating enough options, you ask them: And what else? One of my favorite examples from the book is how when people are presented with two options; they make worse decisions than choosing at random. However, if a 3rd option is presentedâ€”they make much better decisions on average (I'm not sure how a study like that is conducted, but I definitely agree with this).<br /><br />Another quote from the book that made me think was: "It doesn't matter if you've mastered all the productivity books in the world; the faster you dig, the faster the world keeps flooding in." I observe this myself too, that more time in doesn't yield more outputâ€”it often just generates more and less important work. It makes you say no less, without proportionally increasing output. <br /><br />The big takeaway from this book is that it's not your job to offer solutions, it's your job to ask the questions that lead to solutionsâ€”that's coaching. The book ends up referring to one of my favorite books, Make it Stick, how people generate memories by AGES: Attention, Generation, Emotion, Spacing. If people aren't generating their own ideas and answers, they don't remember them. I prefer the articulation in "What Got You Here Won't Get You There", of not trying to 'add too much value'â€”although the book does use some of this vocabulary. It's clear that the author is well-read in the management and leadership literature, it's great to see books references and ideas iterated on.</p>
