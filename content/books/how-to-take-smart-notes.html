<p>Note-taking game-changer. Ahrens' is a professor in systematic education at Hamburg Universityâ€”and he really knows his shit. This book tells the story of the remarkable Luhmann note-taking system. Luhmann was a revered sociology professor who collected over 90,000 index cards over the course of his life to support his 30-year-project: "A Theory of Society." The book goes over how Luhmann organized his note-taking in a scalable way that allowed him an unprecedented level of productivity with 30+ published books and 400+ published articles. In particular, how the author has implemented a similar system (with technology, in lieu of paper flashcards). To best summarize the ethos of this fantastic book:<br /><br /><blockquote> To get a good paper written, you only have to rewrite a good draft; to get a good draft written, you only have to turn a series of notes into a continuous text. And as a series of notes is just the rearrangement of notes you already have in your slip-box, all you really have to do is have a pen in your hand when you read. </blockquote>I can't sum up the technique here in short (but luckily, the author did <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-take-notes/answer/S%25C3%25B6nke-Ahrens?srid=uJBsW" rel="nofollow">here</a>), but needless to say, it thoroughly enriched my mental-model for note-taking and have caused me to implement dramatic changes to mine. I am stoked to see how it pans out in the long-term.<br /><br />If you're starting to feel weighed down by your note-taking, rather than pulled upâ€”and if collecting 10,000s of ideas over your lifetime appeals to you, you absolutely need to read this. The book will earn its fifth star if I, a year or so from now, continue to use the system (which I have spent this weekend initiating the migration to).</p>
