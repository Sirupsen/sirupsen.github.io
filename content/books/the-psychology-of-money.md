I've read Housel's content for years and years. I can't recommend this book and
its absurd density of insight enough. Don't let the title fool you: this book is
just as much about designing a good life. For example, that a nice new car
impresses yourself more than anyone else. On one of the first pages Morgan
writes that "financial success is a soft skill, not a hard skill." That about
sets the stage.
