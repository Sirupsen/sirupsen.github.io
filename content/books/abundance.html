<p>Great book focusing on the entrepreneurial opportunities in philanthropy with a refreshing, positive outlook of the future. Whereas Bold, by the same authors, focuses more on general problems and the entrepreneur aspect, Abundance focuses on technologies to provide an excess for the bottom of Marshlaw's: shelter, clean water, food, energy and Internet. While some of the technologies highlighted are certainly outdated at this point, it doesn't hurt the overall experience.</p>
