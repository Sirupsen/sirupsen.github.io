I was hoping for a book with practical advice on throttling yourself to not
accidentally walk off the cliff of burnout, but it didn't accomplish this.

The main insight from this book that's worth holding onto is to "close the loop"
on emotions, e.g. if something someone did really bothers you, make sure you
find a way to not let it spiral out of control (e.g. by talking to the person
about it). Dealing with the thing that causes stress, and the emotion, are two
separate things.
