He uses all the tools Darwin didn't have at their disposal: game theory, genetics, modern medicine, and many others. It is not dense by any means and scattered throughout the book are stories of animals being dicks, such as a parasite that secretes a hormone to cause its larvae home to never turn butterfly and become abnormally large.
