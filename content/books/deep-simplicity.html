<p>A book about how complexity arises from simplicity. The most interesting from this book I'll remember, was the ones about the working of weather prediction. But there are sporadic intersting insights about evolution, fractals, Turing, and power lawsâ€”however, the author tends to circle around the point for too long, which is unfortunate because they're generally good.</p>
