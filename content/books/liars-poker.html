<p>Wanted to read some of Lewis' earlier writing, and it's certainly not as entertaining. I usually take his book's with a grain of salt, as I'm always skeptical of non-fiction with this amount of narrative. Doesn't mean I don't find it entertaining. This book's about his own experiences on the trading floor in the 80s. Certainly a quick read, but I'll likely go through his books in chronological order.</p>
