<p>Subscribe for a monthly "computer napkin problem" where you use
first-principle thinking to arrive at expectations about systems in a jiffy
without writing any code!
Examples from past editions:

<blockquote> What is the expected throughput of a single-threaded, in-memory
data-store like Redis?
<a href="/napkin/problem-4/">Problem 4</a></blockquote>

<blockquote>How much do you expect to pay for the storage of logs cost for a standard, monolithic 100,000 RPS web application? -- <a href="/napkin/problem-1/">Problem 1</a></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote>What do you expect the response time for a query that visits 50
database pages with a 80% page cache hit rate to be? -- <a
href="/napkin/problem-2/">Problem 2</a></blockquote>

With the reference <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math#numbers">napkin math reference numbers</a>
in hand, pen, paper, and some reasonable assumptions (such as average log size
or database record size) you should be able to arrive at an approximate answer.
The idea is that a monthly cadence should be about enough to keep the skill sharp.

primer on the topic.</p>
