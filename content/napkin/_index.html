<p>Roughly monthly you'll receive a post with napkin math calculations where I
employ first-principle thinking to arrive at expectations about systems. On a
good day it'll even include some code to test these assumptions against reality!
Examples from past editions:

<blockquote> What is the expected throughput of a single-threaded, in-memory
data-store like Redis?
<a href="/napkin/problem-4/">Problem 4</a></blockquote>

<blockquote>Is fsyncs per seconds and transactions per second for MySQL always
  the same?-- <a href="/napkin/problem-10-mysql-transactions-per-second/">Problem 1</a></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote>What do you expect the response time for a query that visits 50
database pages with a 80% page cache hit rate to be? -- <a
href="/napkin/problem-2/">Problem 2</a></blockquote>

With the <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math#numbers">napkin math reference numbers</a>
in hand, pen, paper, and some reasonable assumptions (such as average log size
or database record size) we should be able to arrive at an approximate answer.

primer on the topic.</p>
